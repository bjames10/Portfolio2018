        <br>
        <p>The difficulty of this project came from the lack of information, there wasn’t much on their website so there is a lot of theoretical information. I started by writing out my content and then designing the rest based upon it. I made revision throughout
          My information came from the Ross Point site and their Facebook page mostly, I tried to design it similarly to other fact sheets for charity groups that I’d seen used. I am happy with how my project turned out.

        <p>For the final we were to draft a crisis plan that would demonstrating our knowledge of RPIE. The crisis scenario was a case of E. Coli outbreak at a grocery store and how I would handle it if I were in working in the company’s public relations
          team. started my plan by researching E. Coli and the how outbreaks were handled by other company’s (Chipotle). I then moved onto researching the legal implications and what agencies would need to be involved. My format is just a simple list
          in chronological order for a possible campaign. </p>
